### 1. Optimizing Marketing Strategy through Customer Segmentation

</p>

*   **Description:** An end-to-end analysis of an e-commerce dataset to segment customers, identify purchasing patterns, and provide data-driven marketing recommendations.
*   **Technologies:** Python (Pandas), PostgreSQL, SQL, Power BI
*   **Links:** **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SayanrupBarman/customer-behavior-analysis)**

#### Business Problem
An e-commerce business needed to move beyond generic marketing and understand its customer base to drive growth. The key challenge was to extract actionable insights from raw shopping data to identify high-value segments and purchasing patterns.

#### Impact (Result)
The analysis highlighted that male customers generate over double the revenue of female customers, and that spending habits between subscribed and non-subscribed users are nearly identical. This allows the business to refocus marketing on high-revenue demographics and rethink its subscription value proposition.

</p>

*   **Description:** An analysis to identify top-performing UK YouTubers for a marketing campaign by enriching a static dataset with live data from the YouTube API.
*   **Technologies:** Python (YouTube API), SQL Server, Power BI
*   **Links:** **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SayanrupBarman/youtuber-sponshership-analysis)**

#### Business Problem
The marketing department needed to make a data-driven decision on which top UK YouTubers to partner with. The objective was to identify influencers who would provide the highest potential return on investment (ROI).

#### Impact (Result)
The analysis provided a clear framework for selecting influencers. It demonstrated that for maximum subscriber reach, `NoCopyrightSounds` is the top choice, while for campaigns targeting the highest view count, `DanTDM` is the leader. This enables the marketing team to align their choice of YouTuber with strategic goals.

### 3. Building a Scalable Analytics Warehouse for Uber Trip Data

*   **Description:** An end-to-end ETL pipeline to process Uber trip data, model it into a star schema, and load it into a data warehouse for analytics.
*   **Technologies:** Python (Pandas), Google BigQuery, SQL
*   **Links:** **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SayanrupBarman/uber-data-engineering-pipeline.git)**

#### Business Problem
To enable business intelligence on Uber trip data, a robust pipeline was needed to process raw data, transform it into a structured format, and load it into a central data warehouse.

#### Impact (Result)
This project successfully built a modern, scalable data engineering pipeline. The resulting star schema in BigQuery allows analysts to easily query key business metrics like average fare amount ($13.25) and average trip distance (3.03 miles), demonstrating a strong understanding of data warehousing principles.
